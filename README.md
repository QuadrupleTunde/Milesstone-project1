# NJIT-SD-03 Milestone Project: Planning

--------

## Project Description

I am making a Rock Paper Scissors game. It is a hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign.

## Game Logic

```
Two hands Image Src(0ne for Player1 and the other for player2 or computer)
Either one of the players can win or lose.
 Players to choose any of Rock, Paper & Scissors.
 then compared both players
 add some animation to display the shape
 there is a pop up message on who ever win
 and then keep track of the score
 
```

## Deliverables


### MVP Criteria

-  The game must be winnable.
- The game should display visual text either lose or win and if also there is a tie
- 
- 

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)
